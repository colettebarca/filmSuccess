# Predicting a Film’s Success Before Filming Begins
### Goals:
Create a statistical model for prospective financiers that would predict if a movie would be successful based on its proposed featured actors, director, producer, writer, genre, and production company. In this context, a film’s success is quantified using its percent return on investment (ROI).

### Outcomes:
The zero percent ROI’s Logistic Regression model fit with only the four statistically significant predictors produced the most accurate predictions. This suggests that, using the information typically presented with film packaging, it is possible to predict if a particular film will lose money. However, such information is not as effective for predicting how successful the project will be.
